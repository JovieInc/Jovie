# Privacy Policy

_Last updated: January 2025_

## Our Commitment to Privacy

Jovie exists so musicians can share their story with confidence. That means keeping your information safe, using it transparently, and never selling it. We aim for clarity, control, and fast responses whenever you need help.

## Information We Collect

### Account Information

When you create a profile, we collect exactly what we need to deliver the product:

- Email address and verification state (via Clerk authentication)
- Artist metadata synced from Spotify (name, artist ID, profile art)
- Profile customizations such as taglines, social links, and CTA order

### Usage Data

We automatically gather operational signals to keep Jovie reliable:

- Analytics about profile visits, clicks, and link engagement
- Device, browser, and user-agent details for rendering safely
- IP addresses (anonymized for monitoring abuse)

### Third-Party Services

Our stack uses a small set of trusted partners:

- **Clerk** for authentication, identity, and session security
- **Neon** for our Postgres database (with strict RLS policies)
- **Stripe** for billing and customer subscriptions
- **Spotify** for artist discovery and metadata enrichment
- **Statsig** for analytics, experimentation, and feature gating

We never introduce other analytics platforms or tracking cookies without explicit notice.

## How We Use Your Information

Your data powers the experience you signed up for:

- Delivering and personalizing your public artist profile
- Generating analytics to understand performance and health
- Powering the stats and messaging inside the dashboard
- Communicating essential updates or billing notices
- Running experiments safely through Statsig so new experiences stay stable

## Data Sharing

We do not sell data to anyone. We may share data with:

- Service providers who assist in operating Jovie (Clerk, Neon, Stripe, Statsig)
- Legal authorities when required by law or to protect against fraud
- Partners only when you explicitly connect a service (e.g., Spotify)

## Data Security

We protect your data with layered safeguards:

- TLS everywhere plus encryption-at-rest on all databases
- Secure authentication flows powered by Clerk
- Role-based access controls, logging, and routine security reviews
- Minimal data retention aligned with the principle of least privilege

## Your Preferences and Controls

We build in control throughout the experience:

- **Access & correction:** Request a snapshot or update any of your stored data
- **Deletion:** Close your account and your profile data is removed on request
- **Exports:** Download your data for a standalone backup
- **Analytics opt-out:** Contact privacy@jov.ie to opt out of non-essential analytics (we rely on Statsig for core product signals)

## Contact Us

If you have questions about this policy or your data, email privacy@jov.ie.

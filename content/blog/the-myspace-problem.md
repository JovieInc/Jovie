# The MySpace Problem

When I was a teenager, everyone had a MySpace.

It wasn’t optional. If you wanted to exist, you had a MySpace. And if you were into music, especially, it was *the* place. Bands broke there. Songs spread there. For a while, it felt like the internet had finally figured out how people were supposed to connect.

Early MySpace was actually pretty simple. Profiles were mostly uniform. But MySpace didn’t lock things down. You could inject HTML and CSS. People started hacking layouts. Then themes emerged. Then full-blown custom pages.

Over time, profiles became louder, slower, and harder to use. Text blended into backgrounds. Music auto-played. Navigation changed from page to page. Each profile required you to re-learn how to interact with it.

I’m not claiming this killed MySpace. But the timing is hard to ignore: as customization increased, usability collapsed.

Then Facebook showed up.

When Facebook first spread beyond colleges, it was shockingly limited. No profile hacking. No music players. Very few knobs to turn. Everyone’s page looked the same. At the time, that felt restrictive.

In retrospect, it was liberating.

You didn’t have to figure anything out. You didn’t have to decode someone’s page. You could just use it. And almost overnight, everyone moved.

This pattern keeps repeating.

In the early 2000s, the assumption was that more choice was always better. AIM let you customize fonts, colors, sounds, away messages. Android let you tweak nearly every part of the interface.

Twenty years later, technology is vastly more advanced—and yet most successful products allow less customization, not more.

That’s not because designers got lazy. It’s because they figured something out.

Apple understood this early. iOS doesn’t let you change much of anything. Android gives you total control. The result? iOS updates hit 90% adoption within months. Android fragments across thousands of device configurations and averages under 30%. Every custom configuration is someone’s perfect setup and everyone else’s edge case.

Tony Fadell talks about this with the iPod. The market was full of MP3 players covered in buttons. Each feature had a control. They were powerful but cluttered.

The iPod replaced all of that with a wheel.

That wasn’t about aesthetics. It was about abstraction. The interface disappeared so the music could take center stage. The other players vanished. The iPod didn’t.

You see the same thing in software. Tinder exploded not because it had more features, but because it had fewer. Swipe left. Swipe right. That was basically it. Meanwhile, competitors added filters, prompts, video, modes, games—and none of them reached the same scale.

Clarity spreads. Options don’t.

And if this matters for general consumer products, it matters especially for artists.

When you release music on Spotify or Apple Music, you pour everything into the song and the album art. That’s the creative work. The two pieces are packaged together—your sound and your visual identity.

But the page where people actually *listen*? That should disappear.

Think about walking into an Apple Store. You don’t navigate a maze of vintage iMacs just to buy a MacBook Pro. The store is minimal. A few products on clean tables. Nothing around them. No clutter. No distraction. If you’ve built a great product, the product sells itself.

Music should work the same way.

When you share your music on Instagram or Facebook, you’re not trying to give someone a Choose Your Own Adventure. You want clarity: this is who I am, I make music, here’s the song I think you’ll like.

Most people won’t read past the first thing they see. They’ll barely read the first thing. So if you send them to a page with ten links stacked vertically—Spotify, Apple Music, YouTube, SoundCloud, Bandcamp, Patreon, merch store, mailing list, TikTok, Instagram—they’re gone.

But if you send them somewhere clean—great photo, clear identity, one obvious next step—they’ll click. They’ll listen. They’ll become fans.

That’s the difference between a stack of links and an actual funnel.

Link-in-bio tools treat the page as a canvas. Unlimited links. Unlimited fonts. Unlimited colors. Every page looks different. Two Linktrees feel like two entirely different products.

That’s framed as creative freedom. What it actually produces is chaos. No hierarchy. No clear next step. Just a pile of equally weighted options all screaming for attention.

Pretty pages get admired. Clear pages get clicked.

This is the modern version of the MySpace problem.

I spent 15 years in music marketing. Worked with Armada, Universal, artists like Tory Lanez. Drove tens of millions of streams. Ran digital campaigns at scale for brands like Google and the NFL. All of that taught me one thing: artists shouldn’t be doing this work.

Musicians should be making music. Not learning CSS. Not debating whether their CTA button should be blue or green. Not manually updating tour dates across six platforms. Not running their own A/B tests to figure out which headline gets the most clicks.

When I started building Jovie, the core insight was simple: the link isn’t the art. The music is.

Kaskade said it best: “Let the music speak.”

He doesn’t talk over the set. He doesn’t hype between tracks. He just plays. The music does the work. That restraint isn’t laziness—it’s respect for the craft.

The same principle applies to conversion. Look at Amazon checkout. Stripe’s payment flow. The best-performing Shopify stores. They all do the same thing: remove everything that isn’t the decision. No sidebars. No competing CTAs. No visual noise. The pages that convert highest aren’t the most customizable—they’re the most focused.

Jovie is opinionated by design. One profile photo. One primary call to action. Dark mode and light mode that actually work on every device. No HTML. No layout options. No font picker.

That’s not restriction—it’s leverage.

Behind the scenes, we use AI to optimize every page for every user on every visit. Which CTA performs better for *your* audience. Which profile photo converts. Which layout hierarchy gets more clicks. The system learns, tests, and improves while you sleep.

That’s how AI should work. Empowering creativity, not replacing it.

Design decisions are centralized so they can improve over time. The artist uploads music, books shows, and moves on. The page handles the rest.

Less expression in the wrapper. More power behind the work.

The products that win at scale all made this trade. Facebook’s uniform profiles over MySpace’s custom chaos. The iPod’s single wheel over cluttered button arrays. Tinder’s swipe over dating apps with endless filters.

The mistake isn’t giving users freedom. It’s giving them responsibility they shouldn’t have to carry.

Creativity belongs in the work.

Everything else should get out of the way.

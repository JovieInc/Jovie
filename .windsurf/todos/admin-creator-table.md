# TODO - Admin creator table tweaks
- [ ] Shrink username text on creator rows (keep two-line layout: bold name, smaller username).
- [ ] Keep header sticky and aligned; ensure rows don’t overlap.
- [ ] Maintain refresh-in-menu behavior; avatar loader + smooth row transitions (if pending).
- [ ] Re-run eslint/biome after style tweaks.

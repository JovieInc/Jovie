## TODO - Link Manager UX Densify (Created by Cascade)
- [x] Reduce card padding/height (~10–15%), darken borders slightly, thin dark-mode borders, add hover/active micro-interactions.
- [x] Soften URL typography (smaller size, reduced opacity, trimmed protocol/path).
- [x] Adjust category headers (spacing above grid; low-contrast label/divider/icon treatment).
- [x] Refine link count indicator to single-line, subtle; hide/replace when complete.
- [x] Update affordances: ellipsis menu instead of floating delete dot; hover tint + active scale; drag handle shown on hover.
- [ ] Animate category collapse (chevron + fade/height), new-link pulse; keep cards visible while adding.

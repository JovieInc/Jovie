# TODO - Contact sidebar actions micro-interactions
- [ ] Add micro-interactions (hover/active/focus transitions, scale/opacity) to header action buttons (copy, refresh, open, close).
- [ ] Extract header action buttons into atomic components (e.g., ContactHeaderAction, ContactHeaderActions) following atomic architecture.
- [ ] Ensure icon sizing/spacing consistent; align with sidebar tokens (bg, border, text).
- [ ] Verify keyboard/focus states remain accessible.
- [ ] Re-run lint/tests if needed.

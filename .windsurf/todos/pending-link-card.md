## Pending link card inline behavior

- [ ] Move the “Ready to add” pending link card from under the input into the grouped link list (social/custom sections).
- [ ] Cancel button: remove the pending card and clear the input.
- [ ] Add button: persist the link and keep it in the list; clear the input afterward.
- [ ] Verify social platforms (e.g., Snapchat/TikTok) render under Social, not Custom.
- [ ] Run lint/typecheck and prepare commit/push.

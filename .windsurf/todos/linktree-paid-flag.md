# TODO - Linktree/Beacons icon + paid flag
- [ ] Add DB flag to mark linktree entries as paid (detect absence of referral/branding link during ingest).
- [ ] Update ingest (linktree strategy) to set flag on social_links (or equivalent) when branding link missing; keep platform detection for Beacons.
- [ ] Surface icon column in admin creator table showing Linktree/Beacons presence and paid indicator.
- [ ] Ensure pending rows/ingest UI remains stable.
- [ ] Run lint/typecheck/tests after changes.

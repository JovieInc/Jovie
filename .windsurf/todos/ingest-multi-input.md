# TODO - Ingest menu multi-input
- [ ] Update ingest menu to include a textarea for bulk input: stack of links or comma-separated handles/URLs.
- [ ] Parse mixed input (split by newline and comma), trim, dedupe, validate Linktree/handle formats.
- [ ] Show per-item status (pending/ingesting) using existing pendingProfiles flow.
- [ ] Keep single-link flow working.
- [ ] Handle errors with toast and ignore invalid entries.

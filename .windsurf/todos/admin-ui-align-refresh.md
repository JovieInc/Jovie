# TODO - Admin UI alignment + refresh
- [ ] Align header and contact sidebar backgrounds/borders to match left nav (use Sidebar tokens: bg-sidebar, border-sidebar-border, etc.).
- [ ] Move bulk actions control into header over username column; remove redundant top bar; match styling.
- [ ] Render name/username as two lines (bold displayName, smaller username).
- [ ] Add per-row "Refresh ingest" action with loading/toast; reload row data after success.
- [ ] Contact sidebar: hydrate from creator (displayName, username, avatar, socials) and keep in sync after refresh.
- [ ] Align contact sidebar border with header; ensure dark/light consistency.
- [ ] Run lint/tests as needed.

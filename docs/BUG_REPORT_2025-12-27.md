## Detailed Bug Descriptions

### CRITICAL BUGS (Revenue/Data Loss Risk)

#### 1. Silent Failure in Payment Success Webhook

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` (Lines 483-525)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Easy

The `handlePaymentSucceeded` function catches errors but does NOT re-throw them. If any error occurs while updating the user's billing status, the webhook will still be marked as processed successfully by Stripe.

```typescript
catch (error) {
  await captureCriticalError('Error handling payment success webhook', error, {...});
  // BUG: No re-throw - Stripe thinks webhook succeeded
}
```

**Impact:** Users pay but never receive Pro status. Revenue is collected but service not delivered.

**Fix:** Add `throw error;` after logging to ensure Stripe retries failed webhooks.

---

#### 2. Payment Failed Webhook Doesn't Downgrade Users

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` (Lines 527-617)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Easy

The `handlePaymentFailed` function silently returns if subscription retrieval fails or userId is missing. Users who should be downgraded continue having Pro access.

**Impact:** Users with failed payments keep Pro features indefinitely, causing revenue loss.

**Fix:** Add error re-throwing and explicit handling for missing userId scenarios.

---

#### 3. Race Condition in Audience Member Upsert

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/audience/click/route.ts` (Lines 256-296)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Medium

When `onConflictDoNothing` fails to insert, the code tries to fetch the conflicting record, but another transaction could delete it in between.

```typescript
if (!inserted) {
  member = await findAudienceMember(tx, profileId, fingerprint);
  // Race: record could be deleted between conflict and this SELECT
}
if (!member) {
  throw new Error('Unable to resolve audience member'); // This can happen!
}
```

**Impact:** Analytics data loss, API errors during high-traffic periods.

**Fix:** Use `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT DO UPDATE` instead of `DO NOTHING` to guarantee a row is returned.

---

#### 4. Race Condition in Track API Upsert

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/track/route.ts` (Lines 185-247)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Medium

Same race condition pattern as Bug #3. The fallback SELECT after `onConflictDoNothing` can return null.

**Impact:** Click tracking fails, analytics gaps, potential 500 errors.

**Fix:** Same as Bug #3 - use upsert pattern that guarantees row return.

---

#### 5. Fire-and-Forget Social Link Click Update

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/track/route.ts` (Lines 327-350)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Easy

Social link click counter is updated OUTSIDE the transaction with `void socialLinkUpdate` - never awaited.

```typescript
const socialLinkUpdate = linkType === 'social' ? db.update(...).catch(...) : null;
if (socialLinkUpdate) {
  void socialLinkUpdate; // Fire-and-forget!
}
```

**Impact:** Click counts become inconsistent with actual click events. Analytics unreliable.

**Fix:** Move update inside the transaction and await it.

---

### HIGH BUGS (Significant Impact)

#### 6. Orphaned Stripe Customers on Concurrent Updates

**File:** `apps/web/lib/stripe/customer-sync.ts` (Lines 154-198)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

After creating a Stripe customer, if the optimistic locking update fails, the function returns success anyway. Customer created but not linked to database.

**Impact:** Orphaned Stripe customers, billing issues on retry, potential double charges.

**Fix:** Return error on optimistic lock failure or implement cleanup of orphaned customer.

---

#### 7. Module-Level CRON_SECRET Capture

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/cron/waitlist-invites/route.ts` (Line 14)
**Importance:** CRITICAL | **Difficulty:** Easy

```typescript
const CRON_SECRET = process.env.CRON_SECRET; // Captured at module load
```

If `CRON_SECRET` is undefined at cold start, ALL cron requests fail authorization permanently.

**Impact:** All cron jobs fail silently, waitlist invites never sent, cleanup jobs never run.

**Fix:** Read `process.env.CRON_SECRET` inside the handler function, not at module level.

---

#### 8. Missing userId Handling in Payment Success

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/stripe/webhooks/route.ts` (Lines 499-512)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Easy

When `userId` is undefined (missing metadata), the function silently returns without processing.

**Impact:** Subscriptions without proper metadata never update the user's status.

**Fix:** Log critical error and throw when userId is missing to trigger webhook retry/alerting.

---

#### 9. Race Condition in Waitlist Invites Rate Limiting

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/cron/waitlist-invites/route.ts` (Lines 88-168)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

Rate limit check happens OUTSIDE the database transaction. Two concurrent cron instances can both pass the rate limit check.

**Impact:** Exceeded rate limits, users receive duplicate invites.

**Fix:** Move rate limit check inside transaction with row locking.

---

#### 10. Missing Concurrent Execution Prevention in Billing Reconciliation

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/cron/billing-reconciliation/route.ts` (Lines 70-141)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

No distributed lock or idempotency check to prevent concurrent execution.

**Impact:** Same users processed multiple times, unnecessary Stripe API calls.

**Fix:** Implement distributed locking or job status tracking.

---

#### 11. Admin Role Cache Race Condition

**File:** `apps/web/lib/admin/roles.ts` (Lines 10-27)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

5-minute cache TTL means demoted admins retain access for up to 5 minutes after demotion.

**Impact:** Unauthorized admin access after permission revocation.

**Fix:** Reduce TTL or implement cache invalidation on role change.

---

#### 12. Missing RLS Session Setup in Non-Transaction Context

**File:** `apps/web/lib/db/index.ts` (Lines 335-345)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

`setSessionUser()` uses `SET LOCAL` (transaction-scoped) inconsistently with session-scoped `set_config()`.

**Impact:** Potential unauthorized data access if RLS bypassed.

**Fix:** Standardize on session-scoped `set_config()` for all RLS setup.

---

#### 13-14. Orphaned Blob Storage

**Files:** `images/upload/route.ts:411-481`, `dashboard/profile/route.ts:388-405`
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Medium

When users upload new avatars, previous blobs are never deleted from Vercel Blob storage.

**Impact:** Storage quota exhaustion, unnecessary costs, orphaned files accumulate.

**Fix:** Query for existing avatar URL before update, delete old blob after successful update.

---

#### 15. past_due/unpaid Status Blocks Checkout

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/stripe/checkout/route.ts` (Lines 80-85)
**Importance:** HIGH | **Difficulty:** Easy

Users with `past_due` or `unpaid` subscriptions are blocked from creating new checkout sessions.

```typescript
const activeSubscriptionStatuses = new Set([
  'active', 'trialing', 'past_due', 'unpaid' // Blocks these users from checkout!
]);
```

**Impact:** Users can't pay overdue bills, churn increases, revenue lost.

**Fix:** Remove `past_due` and `unpaid` from blocking statuses or redirect to portal.

---

### MEDIUM BUGS (Moderate Impact)

#### 16. Duplicate Tip Processing Silently Ignored

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/capture-tip/route.ts` (Lines 93-112)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Duplicate tips are silently ignored with only `console.log`. No way to distinguish legitimate duplicates from system failures.

**Fix:** Use structured logging with event type to distinguish scenarios.

---

#### 17. Missing Transaction Isolation for Handle Availability

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/handle/check/route.ts` (Lines 205-210)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Medium

Handle availability check doesn't use transaction, allowing race conditions during profile creation.

**Fix:** Wrap check in serializable transaction or rely on unique constraint with proper error handling.

---

#### 18. Idempotency Key Storage Failure Not Retried

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/dashboard/social-links/route.ts` (Lines 147-152)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Idempotency key insert failures are only logged, never retried.

**Fix:** Consider storing idempotency key before operation, not after.

---

#### 19-21. React Memory Leaks (setTimeout without cleanup)

**Files:**
- `AppleStyleOnboardingForm.tsx:149-167` (250ms timeouts)
- `DashboardFeedbackModal.tsx:44-72` (2000ms + nested 300ms)
- `ListenNowForm.tsx:29-46` (500ms debounce)

**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Multiple components with `setTimeout` not cleaned up on unmount.

**Impact:** Memory leaks, "setState on unmounted component" warnings.

**Fix:** Store timeout IDs in refs and clear them in useEffect cleanup.

---

#### 22. Stack Trace Information Disclosure

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/health/auth/route.ts` (Line 76)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Error stack traces leaked in API responses.

**Fix:** Never return `error.stack` in responses; log it server-side only.

---

#### 23. Clerk Webhook Returns 200 on Failure

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/clerk/webhook/route.ts` (Lines 155-163)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Returns HTTP 200 on processing failure, preventing Clerk retries.

**Fix:** Return 500 on failure to trigger webhook retry.

---

#### 24. Timing Attack on CRON_SECRET

**Files:** Multiple cron files
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Easy

Uses simple string comparison instead of `crypto.timingSafeEqual`.

**Fix:** Use timing-safe comparison for all secret validation.

---

#### 25. Non-Atomic Blob+DB Deletion

**File:** `apps/web/app/api/cron/cleanup-photos/route.ts` (Lines 93-120)
**Importance:** MEDIUM | **Difficulty:** Medium

Blobs deleted first, then individual DB delete queries without transaction.

**Fix:** Delete DB records in batch transaction, then delete blobs.

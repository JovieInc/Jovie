# /ideate - Ideation Orchestrator

Run comprehensive ideation analysis to discover improvement opportunities across UI/UX, code patterns, quality, and performance.

## Arguments

- `[type]` - Analysis type: `all` | `ui` | `code` | `quality` | `perf` (default: `all`)
- `[path]` - Target directory (default: `apps/web`)

## Examples

```bash
/ideate                    # Run all ideation types on apps/web
/ideate ui                 # UI/UX improvements only
/ideate quality            # Code quality/refactoring only
/ideate perf apps/web/lib  # Performance analysis on specific path
```

## Ideation Types

| Type | Focus | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| `ui` | UI/UX, accessibility, visual consistency | ui-ux-ideas.json |
| `code` | Pattern extensions, feature opportunities | code-ideas.json |
| `quality` | Refactoring, code smells, tech debt | quality-ideas.json |
| `perf` | Bundle size, runtime, caching | perf-ideas.json |

## Phase 1: Context Gathering

### 1.1 Query Linear for Existing Issues

Before running any ideation, check what's already tracked:

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__list_issues:
- team: "Jovie" (or appropriate team)
- limit: 100

Filter for labels:
- ui, ux, accessibility
- enhancement, feature
- refactoring, tech-debt
- performance, optimization
```

Store issue IDs to avoid duplicate suggestions.

### 1.2 Check Previous Ideation

```bash
# Load previous ideation results for context
cat .claude/ideation/ui-ux-ideas.json 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat .claude/ideation/code-ideas.json 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat .claude/ideation/quality-ideas.json 2>/dev/null | head -50
cat .claude/ideation/perf-ideas.json 2>/dev/null | head -50
```

## Phase 2: Run Ideation Agents

Based on the `type` argument, run the appropriate sub-agents.

### For `type: all` (default)

Launch all four agents in parallel using the Task tool:

```
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Run UI/UX ideation...")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Run code improvements ideation...")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Run quality ideation...")
Task(subagent_type: "general-purpose", prompt: "Run performance ideation...")
```

Each agent should follow its respective command file:
- `.claude/commands/ideate-ui.md`
- `.claude/commands/ideate-code.md`
- `.claude/commands/ideate-quality.md`
- `.claude/commands/ideate-perf.md`

### For specific type

Run only the requested agent with its full instructions.

## Phase 3: Aggregate Results

After all agents complete, create a summary:

```json
// .claude/ideation/summary.json
{
  "generated_at": "ISO timestamp",
  "scope": "apps/web",
  "types_run": ["ui", "code", "quality", "perf"],
  "linear_issues_checked": 100,
  "totals": {
    "ui": { "total": 5, "high_priority": 2 },
    "code": { "total": 4, "high_priority": 1 },
    "quality": { "total": 6, "high_priority": 3 },
    "perf": { "total": 3, "high_priority": 1 }
  },
  "top_priorities": [
    { "type": "quality", "id": "qual-001", "title": "..." },
    { "type": "ui", "id": "uiux-003", "title": "..." }
  ]
}
```

## Phase 4: Linear Integration

### 4.1 Report High-Priority Findings

After aggregation, present high-priority items:

```markdown
## Ideation Complete

Found **X high-priority improvements** not tracked in Linear:

### UI/UX (2)
- [uiux-001] Add loading skeleton to UserProfile
- [uiux-003] Improve form error visibility

### Code Quality (3)
- [qual-002] Split large API handler file
- [qual-005] Extract duplicated validation logic

Would you like me to create Linear issues for these?
```

### 4.2 Create Linear Issues (on approval)

For each approved finding:

```
mcp__claude_ai_Linear__create_issue:
- team: "Jovie"
- title: "[{type}] {idea title}"
- description: |
    ## Problem
    {current_state}

    ## Proposed Change
    {proposed_change}

    ## Rationale
    {rationale}

    ## Affected Files
    {affected_files as bullet list}

    ## Effort: {effort}

    ---
    Generated by /ideate command
- labels: [{appropriate labels}]
```

## Output Summary

```markdown
## Ideation Results

### Scope
- Path: {path}
- Types: {types_run}
- Linear issues checked: {count}

### Ideas Generated

| Type | Total | High | Medium | Low |
|------|-------|------|--------|-----|
| UI/UX | X | X | X | X |
| Code | X | X | X | X |
| Quality | X | X | X | X |
| Performance | X | X | X | X |

### Output Files
- `.claude/ideation/ui-ux-ideas.json`
- `.claude/ideation/code-ideas.json`
- `.claude/ideation/quality-ideas.json`
- `.claude/ideation/perf-ideas.json`
- `.claude/ideation/summary.json`

### Linear Issues Created
- {list of created issues with URLs}
```

## Critical Rules

1. **Check Linear First** - Always query existing issues before running ideation
2. **No Duplicates** - Skip ideas that match existing Linear issues
3. **Ask Before Creating** - Never auto-create Linear issues without user approval
4. **Parallel Execution** - Run sub-agents in parallel when `type: all`
5. **Aggregate Properly** - Create summary.json after all agents complete
6. **Reference Files** - Each idea must include specific file paths

## Jovie-Specific Context

When running ideation, consider:
- TanStack Query patterns for data fetching
- `@jovie/ui` components from packages/ui
- Tailwind design tokens from tailwind.config.ts
- Sentry for error tracking (no console.*)
- Drizzle ORM for database queries
- Next.js 15 App Router patterns

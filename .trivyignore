# Trivy Ignore Configuration for Jovie
# https://aquasecurity.github.io/trivy/latest/docs/configuration/filtering/
#
# This file lists CVE IDs that should be ignored during vulnerability scanning.
# Use this file for:
# - Vulnerabilities with no available fix (vendor-pending)
# - False positives specific to our usage
# - Accepted risks with documented rationale
#
# =============================================================================
# Format
# =============================================================================
# Each line should contain a CVE ID (e.g., CVE-2024-12345)
# Comments start with # and are ignored
# Blank lines are ignored
#
# Example entries:
#   CVE-2024-12345  # No fix available, low risk in our context
#   CVE-2024-67890  # False positive - we don't use affected function
#
# =============================================================================
# Best Practices
# =============================================================================
# 1. Always document WHY a CVE is ignored (add a comment on the same line)
# 2. Periodically review ignored CVEs for available fixes
# 3. Remove entries once a fix is available and applied
# 4. Only ignore CVEs after security team review
#
# =============================================================================
# Accepted Vulnerabilities
# =============================================================================
# Add CVE IDs below this line with justification comments:
#
# Currently no vulnerabilities are being ignored.
# This file is ready for future CVE exceptions as needed.

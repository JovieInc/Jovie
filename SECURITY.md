# Security Policy

## Supported Releases

Jovie follows a rolling release model on `main` and treats the latest production deployment as the supported version.

| Version | Supported |
| --- | --- |
| `main` (latest) | ✅ |
| Older snapshots | ❌ |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability, please **do not** open a public issue.

Instead, report it privately by email:

- **security@jovie.fm**

Include as much detail as possible:

- A clear description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact assessment (if known)
- Any proof-of-concept details

### Response Targets

We aim to:

1. Acknowledge receipt within **2 business days**
2. Provide a triage update within **5 business days**
3. Share remediation status and coordinated disclosure timing once validated

## Coordinated Disclosure

We support responsible, coordinated disclosure. After a fix is available, we may publish a security advisory with credit (if requested).

## Security Program Signals

To improve open-source security posture and Scorecard outcomes, this repository tracks OpenSSF best practices and security hygiene in:

- `docs/security/SECURITY_REVIEW.md`
- `docs/security/OPENSSF_BEST_PRACTICES.md`
